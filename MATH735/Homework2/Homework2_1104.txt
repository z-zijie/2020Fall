Homework 2

NOTE please submit only one file!!!  If you take photos please combine them into one single file. Thanks.

1) In Timo’s notes, there are two ways to think of the quadratic covariation [X,Y]  either (2.13) as a limit, or (2.14) via quadratic variation. In the video lecture, we computed [X,Y] where X,Y are two independent Brownian motions using (2.14).  Please re-prove this result using (2.13).

2) Read Lemma A.10 and Corollary A.11 in Timo’s notes (including proofs, but no need to write anything down). Then, use it to compute the quadratic variations [N] and [M] where N is Poisson process and M is compensated Poisson process. (Note the method we used to compute quadratic variation of BM in the lecture could in principle be used for Poisson, but it would be quite complicated)

3) Prove Proposition 3.34(b) in Timo’s notes.  You could of course copy the proof there, but make sure you understand.

4) In Lecture 5.5 “Ito formula”, we only discussed part A_n and B_n in the proof of Ito formula.  Show that the part C_n converges to 0.

 

For the rest of the homework please see the attachments which are exercises from Chapter 3, 4 of Oksendal’s book

5)  3.1,  3.3,  3.4,

6)  3.7 - Ignore the questions (a)(b)(c) there. Just prove (3.3.8) there for any n.  If you’re not able to prove it for any n, at least prove it for n=1,2,3.

7)  4.1,  4.11
