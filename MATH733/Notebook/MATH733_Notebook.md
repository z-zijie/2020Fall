## Course content
We cover selected portions of Chapters 1-4 of Durrett. This is a rough course outline:  
* Weeks 1-2: Foundations, properties of probability spaces
* Independence, 0-1 laws, strong law of large numbers
* Characteristic functions, weak convergence and the central limit theorem
* Conditional expectation, Martingales  
The course continues in the spring semester as Math 734 covering topics such as Markov chains, stationary processes, ergodic theory, and Brownian motion.

## Evaluation
Course grades will be based on **biweekly**
* home work assignments (25%)
* class participation (15%)
* midterm exam (30%)
* final exam (30%)

## What is probability theory?
**Goal:** model uncertain events, quantify...  
## Simple example with built in symmetry
1. Filp a fair coin. What's the probability of tails?  
  Normal average : $\frac{1}{2}$  
2. We filp a fair coin 10 times. What's the probability of getting 10 tails?
